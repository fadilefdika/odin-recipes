                <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric </li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander </li>
                <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper </li>
                <li>1 tablespoon water </li>
                <li>1 (15 ounce) can crushed tomatoes </li>
                <li>1 cup plain yogurt </li>
                <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt </li>
                <li>½ cup water </li>
                <li>1 teaspoon garam masala </li>
                <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Instructions:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Sprinkle the chicken breasts with 2 teaspoons salt.</li>
                    <li>Heat the oil in a large skillet over high heat; partially cook the chicken in the hot oil in batches until completely browned. Transfer the browned chicken breasts to a plate and set aside.</li>
                    <li>Reduce the heat under the skillet to medium-high; add the onion, garlic, and ginger to the oil remaining in the skillet and cook and stir until the onion turns translucent, about 8 minutes. Stir the curry powder, cumin, turmeric, coriander, cayenne, and 1 tablespoon of water into the onion mixture; allow to heat together for about 1 minute while stirring. Mix the tomatoes, yogurt, 1 tablespoon chopped cilantro, and 1 teaspoon salt into the mixture. Return the chicken breast to the skillet along with any juices on the plate. Pour 1/2 cup water into the mixture; bring to a boil, turning the chicken to coat with the sauce. Sprinkle the garam masala and 1 tablespoon cilantro over the chicken.</li>
                    <li>Cover the skillet and simmer until the chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Sprinkle with lemon juice to serve.</li>
                </ol>
